|02     Welcome to the new user account application.  All aspects of the new user
 account application can be edited or toggled on or off.  In addition, a MPE
 (Mystic Programming Executable) module can be ran before, during, or after
 to allow almost endless possibilities.

 We've decided to keep the new user application fairly simple in this system,
 but it can easily be changed via the System Configuration.  |10Please |02make sure
 you visit your account settings found on the Main Menu for more account
 options.|16|02
