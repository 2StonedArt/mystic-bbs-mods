   With this utility you make cool transition effects with ansi screens. 
   You can load two ansi images and go from one to another with effects 
   like "curtain", matrix style or even wait for a keypress. You can use 
   it between menu screens in your BBS or at login to animate things like 
   logos/banners.

   Usage:
     ansiframes <file1> [command1] [command2] ...

   Commands:
          DE: delay 200ms       LD: delay 500ms   RExxx: slow by xxx ms
       PAUSE: wait for key   FIRST: show 1st img   LAST: show 2nd img

   Clear effects:
     cls clsquarters clshorlines clsvertlines dotsclear

   Effects:
     dotspaint overright overleft overup overdown slideup slidedown
     slideleft curtainclose curtainopen baropen barclose vlines matrix

   You can use many parameters in the command line. Each command has a 
   different use. All commands are case insensitive.
   
              The first command/parameter has to be an ansi file!
                      All images must be 80x25 or less!
   
   DE     : It will stop the execution for 200ms
   LD     : It will stop the execution for 0.5sec
   PAUSE  : It will wait for a keypress
   
   FIRST  : It will display the first image passed as a parameter
   LAST   : It will display the second image (if any).
   RE     : For each effect there is a delay variable. In some effects 
            has to be smaller and in some higher. It depends on your 
            system and how quick you want to make the effect. With this 
            option you can manipulate this delay. You can use it like: 
                  RE1, this means a delay of 1ms
                  RE20, this is a delay of 20ms
                  RE300, this is a delay of 300ms
            Don't give too high values cause in some effects you will wait 
            for a very very very long time to finish... Make tests before 
            you add a command to your BBS.
            
   Lets see some examples:
     
     // it will clear the screen and display the ansi image
     ./ansiframes image.ans cls first
     
     // show the file and wait for a keypress
     ./ansiframes image.ans first pause
   
     // show first image and transition to second with the dotspaint 
       effect
     ./ansiframes image1.ans first image2.ans re1 dotspaint
     
     // switch between two images back and forth
     ./ansiframes image1.ans first image2.ans ld last ld first ld 
      last ld first
      
     // make something like a sliding door effect. it first "closes" to 
        one image and then re-opens to the first one 
      ./ansiframes image1.ans first image2.ans barclose
      ./ansiframes image2.ans image1.ans baropen
      
    // show the image and clear it with the clsquarters effect, with a 
       delay of 100ms
    ./ansiframes image1.ans first ld re100 clsquarters
      
   
   To use it in a BBS, you can add a menu command like above to a menu 
   entry or save multiple commands in a bash script and execute that 
   instead. This way you can make very complicated animations / 
   transitions.
