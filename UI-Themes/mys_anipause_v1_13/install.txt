Animated pause prompt for Mystic v1.12a45+ by maskreet

(REQUIRES 1.12a46 2020/04/29 for it to work in Windows installs)

1. Create a directory off your scripts directory.
   
   Newer versions of Mystic use a themes directory, for example
   /mystic/themes/<theme name>/scripts/
   
   so you'd place this in /mystic/themes/<theme name>/scripts/anipause/
   
2. Edit the .cfg file with your preferred animation speed.
   Instructions for speed values are in the .cfg file.

3. You can use the default pause prompts included (pause.1, pause.2),
   or you can make your own! You can theoretically create an unlimited
   number of pause pause files. The script reads the install directory
   for anything with pause.X, where X is a number from 1 to infinity, and 
   displays a random one.
   
   The pause text files are very easy to setup.
   
   MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A BLANK LINE WITH NO SPACES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE
   PAUSE TEXT FILE!
   
   This lets the script know when to terminate and restart the animation
   properly.

4. Edit your prompts.txt, either with a text editor in your /mystic/themes/<theme name>
   or with the Mystic built-in prompt editor in your Mystic cfg.
   
   Look for line 22, the pause prompt.
   
   Replace it with
      #<path/to/your/anipause/dir/>anipause.mpy
	  
   For example, a default install would be:
      #/mystic/themes/default/scripts/anipause/anipause.mpy

Revision notes:

   version 1.0  - initial release
   version 1.01 - fixed minor glitch with first display of prompt, added additional
                  instructions for config
   version 1.02 - added a function to keep a node from locking if a user hung up
                  while the prompt was displaying (thanks, xqtr!); adjusted the
				  default speed to something a little more pleasing; added another
                  sample pause prompt
   version 1.1  - was able to get the script working 100% in Windows installs thanks
                  to g00r00 adding a new function
   version 1.11 - fixed the issue with the prompt scrolling upwards once it hit line 25
                  with no status bar, line 24 with a status bar
   version 1.12 - Corrected the wherey() check (24 no status bar, 23 with); increased
                  the speed of the animation by a smidge to be more aesthetically 
                  pleasing
   version 1.13 - Added an OS check to make sure each OS got the proper sequence of
                  display values
