	; Calculating suggested words is a very intensive process, and on some slower

	; option causes the auto suggest to kick in only when a key has not been
	; pressed for half of a second.  When off, words will be suggested in real
	; time which may provide a better feel, but this can be very processor
	; intensive particularly on lower end systems.
