                            -=-= Change Log =-=-
							
1.00a -=>  First pre-release
1.00b -=>  Output modifications
1.00c -=>  Changed code to not create empty .RPT file if no TICs are present
1.00d -=>  Fixed bug created in 1.0c of not placing report file in correct 
		   directory
1.00e -=>  Adjusted output to utilize more of the screen. Added code to ensure
		   report file would end up in correct directory
1.00f -=>  Fixed many bugs - main bug was not deleting the old report before 
		   creating new one.
1.01a -=>  Cleaned up code - Made sure it was ready for public release
1.01b -=>  Major Bug fix - Program could go into infinate loop 
           Corrected typos in this text file
1.01c -=>  Bug fix (damn typos)... :)
1.01d -=>  Minor bug fixes - Added date/time of report generation
1.01e -=>  Optimized code
1.01f -=>  Fixed small bugs of not pulling origin or area desctiption fields
1.01g -=>  Added help for when program is run without command line parameters
           or if run with 'mtafile ?' - Implemented accomodation for incorrect
           formatting of TIC files. MTAFile will now read multiple 'Desc'
           lines in the TIC file. 
1.2.0.2 -=>Major changes! Changed version numbering to match versioning in
           Lazarus. Now uses array of records to hold information from TIC
           files. This allows some manipulation when outputing to text file.
           Files are now grouped by file echo name. Duplicate file listings
           are no longer outputted into the report. Turned off debug mode in
           Lazarus, so executable file size will be much smaller. Added more
           checks in the duplicate file protection. Program will now be able
           to check better, which files belong in which echo listing.
1.5.0.4 -=>Another Major change! Complete re-write of the code. This not only
           made it easier to read, but also to debug. Was able to add sorting
           of both the areas in the output file, while also the filenames
           within the areas. (mark that off the ToDo list) :) Added additional
           logging to help with debugging. If the logs start getting too large
           I will cut some of it back. Changed to work with .TIC information
           in memory, instead of utilizing a temp file. Added comments to code
           so I don't forget what the procedures are designed to do... :) 
1.5.1.1 -=>Cleaned up code, a lot! This was the first program I started
           writing in Pascal, and it was a mess. 700+ lines of code, in a
           total of 3 procedures... 
1.5.1.7 -=>Corrected a couple of errors. One of them being the version 
           mismatch, the other was the incorrect operating system being 
           displayed in the Windows version. This is now read from the systems
           operating system, instead of being hard-coded into the program.
           The program is also now determining if the system is running 32 or
           64 bit. Help, using the ? as a command line parameter, will now
           display only the information for your operating system.
1.5.4.1 -=>More major changes! Added a config file to store most of the options
           the program. Added the ability to set where you would like the log
           file to be located. MTAFile has been creating a data file which
           contains information about each run of the program. Now, this info
           is being used to create a report which shows the incoming stats
           for the last x number of runs. Added error checking to make sure 
           there are .tic files in the given directory. If there aren't, the 
           program will give an error message and exit.
1.5.4.3 -=>Major bug fix in the Linux version. Windows seems to be unaffected
1.5.6.1 -=>Changed to an generic config file that will be used for multiple
           programs. Fixed a bug where the program was displaying multiple
           'Area' insertions into the output file, when not needed. Also 
           increased the number of .tic files that can be processed on each
           run of the program. Per request, added a screen output which states
           the program has completed and exited normally.(Thanks dream master)
1.5.6.3 -=>Finally able to compile a 32bit version for Linux! :) The config
           file name has changed to rcs.ini. There are many additions made to 
           the config file, as it will now be used by multiple programs. 
1.6.4.2 -=>Cleaned up and optimized some code. Changed formating of numbers to
           show 5 Mb, instead of 5,398,205 bytes. Made a few cosmetic changes
           to the output file for better readability.
1.7.1.1 -=>Added some comments to the code, so I can figure out what the heck I
           was doing at the time of writing it. :) Decided the program was
           running smoothly on this end, and should release the newest version
1.7.2.1 -=>Decided it was time to open this project up to the world. From this 
           version on, it will be open source, and I'll try to keep this up to
	       date on github as well. You are free to modify this code in any way
    	   you would like. The only thing I ask, is that if changes are made, 
	       please send me a copy to see what was changed. Just call it my 
    	   curiosity getting the better of me. :)
2.0.0.0 -=>I've bumped the version to 2.0.0.0, so that it's easier to see when
           the change to open source was done. I've also added a few more notes
           to the code. I hope everything is commented enough to let you know 
           what I was doing. The current version of the code can be found at:
