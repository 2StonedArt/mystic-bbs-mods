   this is a sysop menu for mystic bbs. its different from the default one in
   feel and usage. it has menus with stuff a sysop would definitely need and
   with out unnecessary stuff. quick , flexible and customize-able.
   
   it doesn't need external files (like ansi, text files). all stuff are self
   drawn with mci codes and it can be used under ascii menus/themes. it uses 
   lightbar menus as well hotkeys.

   ::/ drop the .mnu file under your menu directory
   ::/ go to the menu editor and either add a new menu command with s255 acs
       to launch this menu, or replace the name of the default one with this.
   ::/ make sure that only the sysop has access to this menu. check your acs
       flags. also check the menu commands! its you responsible for your 
       system not me.

   if you know how to edit a menu... then bring it to your "size". add more 
   stuff, redraw it. if you have suggestions send an email.
   
   the file explorer menu and the text editor menu, will not work "out of the
   box" you have to configure them for your system. change paths, add your
   own command for the file explorer and so.
