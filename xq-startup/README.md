   ::/ step 1
   extract the archive in the mystic folder. it will extract the script 
   and an ansi file to the appropriate folders (scripts and text). If you 
   use different folders for your theme, then add the .mps file to the 
   custom script folder and the .ans to the custom text folder.
   
   ::/ step 2
   compile the startup.mps file with mplc
   
   ::/ step 3
   you are done!!! you don't have to add this to any menu command. mystic 
   will launch it, when you connect to the bbs automatically.
   
   make sure to test this first in a local base!!!! if anything goes 
   wrong and you don't have local access you may be blocked from your 
   bbs.

   ::/ you can edit the startup.ans file to match your bbs theme
   
   ::/ edit the script add/remove/edit your own menus. in the main 
       section there is an array with the menu items info. change the x,y 
       positions and the normal/hightlight text
       
   ::/ the script supports cursor keys and hotkeys. if you change the 
       text in your menu entries, make sure to change the hotkeys at line 
       200
       
   ::/ you can alter the script to match your theme. you can do many 
       things. in my board [andr01d.zapto.org:9999] i added a matrix-like 
       effect while waiting for menu selection. you can think something 
       cooler to do.
       
   ::/ now go and give me those asciicoins i asked you for... hahahaha
