Version = 'v1.0'
Program = 'System Bulletins'

   This program is an adaptation from Darryl Perry's 2016 version
   v2.1 of BBS List Admin Manager (gy-blam)
   Darryl Perry at Cyberia BBS cyberia.darktech.org  port 23
   A very nice and stable BBS List program that allows a Sysop to
   Maintain their BBS List in Mystic and adds some great functions
   to that program.  I've used portions of his program to deal with
   Datafile management as well as Windows (Boxes) and the scrolling
   Selection-Bar.  I tried my own version... (Sucked!!!)... So I
   utilized his implementation for this.

   Bulls is an alternative "Replacement" for
   Mystic BBS's Bulletin program. Instead of
   having to have a BULLETIN.ASC in the
   text folder and only having the bulletins
   in bullet##.asc/ans format, now you can
   point the Bulletins to Any ASCII/ANS File
   you want. This also presents a nice
   Scroll-Bar selection method.  It will
   tell the user if a Bulletin is NEW since
   they last logged on.

Setup is Simple.  Copy bulls.mps and bulls.ini
to your \Mystic\Scripts folder

Run MPLC bulls.mps

Edit the bulls.ini to suit your liking, there
are insructions in there as well.

In Mystic Menu Editor, Edit your call to
Bulletins as such:

(GX) Execute MPL
Data:  bulls

You "Can" specify the .ini file, if you've
renamed it..

Data:  bulls bulls.ini

But the program looks for bulls.ini.  If not
found, it defaults to internal settings..

It will create a new file called bulls.dat,
this is the Data File.

Run the program on your BBS.  It will be blank,
to Add entries, press "A" (You have to have Sysop
Addess of S255 to Add,Delete,Edit entries!

As the Sysop, You can:
  (A)dd an Entry
  (E)dit an Entry
  (D)elete an Entry.

Note: Deleted entries still appear on the list, the use
      won't be able to View it.

Enter the Name of the Bulletin.  You have 70 Characters
so you can add a Lot.

Enter the File Name.  You must enter the FULL Drive:\Path\Filename.ext
when entering this.  For Example:

Windows:  c:\mystic\text\bullet1.asc
     or   c:\mystic\doors\bre\bulletin\scores.txt

Raspberry PI/Linux:  /home/pi/mystic/text/bullet1.asc
                or:  /home/pi/mystic/doors/bre/bulletin/scores.txt

As you can see, you are not limited to the mystic\text directory
or to files called bullet#.asc/ans

You can view ASCII Text or ANSI Files....

Thats about it...
If you like this program, please send me a message/email and tell
me where your BBS is so I can "Check-It-Out"...

Many Tanx
