BULLS - Mystic Bulletins Alternative
Bulls is an alternative "Replacement" for
Mystic BBS's Bulletin program. Instead of
having to have a BULLETIN.ASC in the
text folder and only having the bulletins
in bullet##.asc/ans format, now you can
point the Bulletins to Any ASCII/ANS File
you want. This also presents a nice
Scroll-Bar selection method.  It will
tell the user if a Bulletin is NEW since
they last logged on.
